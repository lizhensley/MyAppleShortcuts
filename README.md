## MacOS Shortcuts
### General Use Shortcuts
- [Join Next Meeting](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/43b64d87b7dc4523ae9a86995eee02e4)
    - Finds your next upcoming meeting with a Google Meet or Zoom link, parses that URL, and joins that meeting
    - For Zoom meetings, if the user has the native Zoom app downloaded, joins in the native desktop app instead of opening the URL in the browser
    - Assumes that your calendar of choice is synced with Apple's native Calendar app
- [Summarize My Emails](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/774a665fff894c9ba3e2309c33fcd7a8)
    - Opens Apple Intelligence and types "Summarize my emails for today" ðŸ¤ª
    - Mainly including this as a template for any Apple Intelligence-related shortcut development    <details><summary><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b></summary>
      So AppleScript does not support keystrokes for the Function and Command keys, which means that you can't replicate the default "Command+Command" shortcut for opening Apple Intelligence.
      <br/>To make this script work, I updated the Keyboard Shortcut under System Settings -> Apple Intelligence & Siri -> Siri Requests to OptionâŒ¥ + S.
      If you set your shortcut to something else, you will need to update the AppleScript for this shortcut.

### Developer Shortcuts
- [Commit & Push Code Changes](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5db00b1cd17d41969306f50b784b2879)

     - When the shortcut runs, it will ask you what project you would like to commit changes in
     - Also includes prompts for commit message & branch name
     - Assumes no merge issues
  
### Personalized Shortcuts
These shortcuts are tailored to my workflow preferences, but could be edited to be useful for other people.
