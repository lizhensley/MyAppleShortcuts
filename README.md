# Apple Shortcuts
Shortcuts I've made for MacOS and iOS

- [Join Next Meeting](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/14e7cc430ac84ed5b11359b7eed9b327)
    - Finds your next upcoming meeting with a Google Meet or Zoom link, parses that URL, and joins that meeting
    - For Zoom meetings, joins in the native desktop app instead of opening the URL in the browser
